					collab.soundscape is a collaborative musical net art
					installation that enables users to create soundscapes and
					ambient music together using a web browser. To join the
					collective soundscape, simply enter your name and location
					on the home page. Once you have joined, you will be given
					a unique on-screen "firefly" to click and drag. The position
					of this firefly effects an audio sample that is assigned to you 
					when you join.

					As you move your firefly around the screen, other fireflies (users) may
					begin to appear. At this point you will begin to hear other samples and
					changes created through their fireflies on-screen position. Listen to the
					resulting soundscape and contribute by placing your firefly in an ideal
					location. Feel free to experiment with your fireflies placement, hang out
					and chat with other users, or even plan a visit to the site with your
					friends for a group performance!

				<div id="longText">
					collab.soundscape uses the Nexus Hub and Tone.js frameworks to load
					and play back audio files and pass messages between users. In total
					there are 158 unique ambient audio samples that can be randomly assigned.
					The samples were gathered using the Freesound API with a filter of
					C minor.
