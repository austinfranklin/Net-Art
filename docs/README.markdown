# Collabscape.io

Collabscape is a collaborative musical net art installation that enables users to create soundscapes and ambient music together using a web browser. Users navigate to the website, enter their name and location, and are given a unique on-screen object to click and drag. The position of this object effects an audio sample that is assigned when the user joins the site. The user info, on-screen object, and the assigned audio sample are broadcast and updated in realtime to all other users on the site using the NexusHub and Tone.js frameworks, and the final musical result is created through the number of users on the site and the position of their objects on screen.

The installation works best using the Google Chrome browser, but is functional on most. Can be viewed on both desktop and mobile devices.
